# Decentralized SCIHub

## Goal

To build an unstoppable SCIHub, We could migrate all the papers into IPFS and capture the indexs, then develop a mirror page that retrieves all the papers from IPFS. It's very hard to download 80+TB of data and pinning them by one person. It will be very helpful if we could have a co-work with all the paper maintainers and developers.

## Cases

We use this repo to collaborate in the following areas:
- :white_check_mark:Host web page to assist torrent maintainers to put the document on IPFS;
- :chart_with_upwards_trend:Collect the index files pushed by all the torrent maintainers;
- :construction:Develop an API that can use the index files;
- :construction:Host a decentralized SCIHub;
